## Abstract

This cEP describes the details of the process of implementing the meta-review
system as a part of the
[GSoC'18 project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5188493739819008).

## Background

People respond to review comments on pull requests by giving feedback. Emoji
make it much easier to give and receive feedback without a long comment thread.
Those emoji are called
[reactions](https://developer.github.com/v4/enum/reactioncontent/) on GitHub
or [award emoji](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/award_emojis.html) on GitLab.
They are used by people to publicly express their feelings about review comments,
which provides feedback to comment authors and all other members.

GitLab is beyond the scope of this project, as GitHub and GitLab have quite
different APIs and most core projects of coala are based on GitHub. This
proposal will only discuss reactions on GitHub, but not award emoji on GitLab.

There are 6 types of reactions on GitHub:

| Name        | Markdown    | Unicode | Emoji |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------- | ----- |
| THUMBS_UP   | `:+1:`      | U+1F44D | üëç    |
| THUMBS_DOWN | `:-1:`      | U+1F44E | üëé    |
| LAUGH       | `:smile:`   | U+1F604 | üòÑ    |
| HOORAY      | `:tada:`    | U+1F389 | üéâ    |
| CONFUSED    | `:confused` | U+1F615 | üòï    |
| HEART       | `:heart:`   | U+FE0F  | ‚ù§Ô∏è    |

There are three types of reviews on a pull request:

1. Issue Comment
   [see sample](https://github.com/coala/gh-board/pull/18#issuecomment-385878735)

2. Review Summary
   [see sample](https://github.com/coala/gh-board/pull/18#pullrequestreview-116783753)

3. Review Discussion
   [see sample](https://github.com/coala/gh-board/pull/18#discussion_r186249423)

Those reactions have been added to GitHub since
[2016 March](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/).
However, they are often used in an adhoc way. They are spread over all PRs
and are not collected and analyzed. Moreover, GitHub doesn't send
notifications to reviewers who receive reactions (see
[related discussion](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/631)).
By tracking reactions, a nice
feedback loop would be created for both senior and junior reviewers.

## Introduction

The meta-review project is about making use of reactions to build a
meta-review system, similar to a meta-moderation system. These responses
are to be collected, processed and displayed on
[gh-board](https://github.com/coala/gh-board), which is a nice kanban
board. Compared to [Huboard](https://huboard.com/) which requires server-side
support, gh-board is serverless.

The scope of this project would exclude non-public meta-reviews. That is,
there would not be any anonymous meta-reviews as that introduces too many
additional complexities. The public only version would be used for
a long time before adding support for non-public meta-reviews.

Note there is a technical limitation in that reactions can not be placed
onto the "review summary", which means general review comments should better
not be put into the "review summary" text box, as it will be not able to be
meta-reviewed.

## Objectives

One goal of this project is to encourage people to do meta-reviews,
systematically. Meta-reviews in need will be displayed on gh-board.
<http://coala.io/meta-review> would be redirected to gh-board page which
shows meta-reviews in need. The implementation details are discussed in the
next section.

Also, to encourage people to do more meta-reviews, statistics of meta-reviews
are to be collected and analyzed. People who do meta-reviews will get scores
according to some metrics. A ranking list is to be displayed on the community
site.

Another objective is that the newcomer process is able to be changed after
this project. Newcomers will be required to finish at least one meta-review and
receive at least one positive meta-review, once this project is ready for
production.

To conclude, this project builds a meta-review system on the community site
and gh-board to display score ranking statistics and meta-reviews in need,
respectively, and encourage people to do meta-review.

## Meanings of reactions

As mentioned in the [background](#background) section, GitHub provides 6 types
of reactions. They have different meanings in the context of meta-review system.

THUMBS_UP and THUMBS_DOWN are most commonly used. They express strong feelings:
THUMBS_UP means the review comment is well-written and helpful, while
THUMBS_DOWN means the review comment is misleading, or even worse, violates
[coala Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/coala/cEPs/blob/master/cEP-0006.md).
They will contribute to the score which is explained in the
[Ranking list](#ranking-list) section.

HEART, HOORAY and LAUGH are reactions that express positive feelings, but not
as clear as THUMBS_UP, and consequently will be excluded from the scoring until
an analysis of how they should be used is done.

CONFUSED expresses negative feeling. CONFUSED are used when people feel the
review comment is not descriptive enough. For example a common advice given
to a newcomer PR is to follow coala guidelines for commit and amend the commit
message. There are various ways in which reviewers can express this, some can
be descriptive enough, some can be very descriptive with links and stuff, also
some can be non descriptive comprising of our internal workflow lingo and hence
non newcomer friendly. If the review comment is confusing, but maybe correct,
then people should definitely give a CONFUSED reaction. It is not clear whether
this should be neutral or negative. As a consequence, it will be excluded from
the scoring until an analysis of how they should be used is done.

## Proposed Approach

### Collection of Meta-reviews

Meta-review info, namely reactions, can be fetched via GitHub API V4 GraphQL.
A sample query is as follows:

```GraphQL
{
  repository(owner: "coala", name: "gh-board") {
    pullRequest(number: 18) {
      author {
        login
        url
      }
      reviews(first: 5) {
        nodes {
          bodyText
          comments(first: 1) {
            nodes {
              bodyText
              author {
                login
                url
              }
              reactions(first: 100) {
                totalCount
                nodes {
                  createdAt
                  content
                  user {
                    login
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
      comments(first: 1) {
        nodes {
          bodyText
          author {
            login
            url
          }
          reactions(first: 100) {
            totalCount
            nodes {
              createdAt
              content
              user {
                login
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The response is in JSON format as follows:

```json

  "data": {
    "repository": {

These pre-fetched issues in database are replaced later anyway.",

            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When a new issue/pull request is detected, gh-board will fetch that issue and
loads it asynchronously. Meta-reviews also need to be fetched during this
procedure.

### Analysis of Meta-reviews

This section explains how meta-review information can be utilized to
generate a meaningful analysis.

#### Ranking list

A ranking list would be displayed on coala community website, according
to points people get. Some metrics are to be collected and used to generate
the ranking formula:

P1 = total number of THUMBS_UP üëç a person gets for all reviews he did.

P2 = total number of THUMBS_UP üëç a person gives to other people for
their reviews.

N1 = total number of THUMBS_DOWN üëé a person gets for all reviews he did.

N2 = total number of THUMBS_DOWN üëé a person gives to other people for
their reviews.

Note P2 and N2 are used to encourage people to get involved in this
reactions feedback system.

An example formula for final score S is:

S = k * (P1 - N1) + c1 * P2 + c2 \* N2

c1 = 0.2, c2 = 0.4, are coefficients. c2 is larger than c1 because people
are usually reluctant to give negative reactions.

k is the impact factor. The higher score a person has, the more impacts he has,
thus his meta-reviews are more valuable. k is based on the scores in the
previous iteration and is normalized. For example, in a previous iteration,
Alice got 2 marks, Bob got 0.8 marks and Charlie got 10 marks. The calculation
procedure would be as follows:

```python
>>> c = [2, 0.8, 10]
>>> max_score = max(c)
>>> min_score = min(c)
>>> result = [(i - min_score) / (max_score - min_score) for i in c]
>>> print(result)
[0.13043478260869565, 0.0, 1.0]
>>> result_adjust = [i + 0.1 for i in result]  # add bias
>>> print(result_adjust)
[0.23043478260869565, 0.1, 1.1]
>>> result_rounded = [round(i, 3) for i in result_adjust]
>>> print(result_rounded)
[0.23, 0.1, 1.1]
```

Therefore, the k factor for Alice, Bob and Charlie in the next iteration would
be: 0.23, 0.1 and 1.1, respectively.

If a person has zeros for all factors, then he is regarded as an inactive
reviewer and would not be displayed. If a person has negative score, he will
still be displayed, but the meta-reviews he gives to other people will not
count.

The ranking formula will reside in the community repo and can be modified over
time in order to achieve different results.

#### Meta-reviews in Need

##### Definition

When does a review need meta-review? There are two perspectives:

1. Meta-review before merge/close. Those review comments need meta-reviews by
   all people. They are sorted according to update time on gh-board. In
   particular, one will always see the review comment that is under his PR
   first.

2. Meta-review after merge/close. Review comments after merge/close need
   meta-reviews by maintainers. Those meta-reviews will reflect the
   accuracy of the review comments. Meta-reviews done by other developers after
   merge/close will not be counted.

Note that review comments by gitmate-bot are not to be meta-reviewed and would
not be displayed on gh-board.

There is also concern for edited comments and deleted comments. Users are able
to edit/delete their review comments on GitHub. If someone receives negative
reactions, they might edit/delete their review comment. To ensure that
meta-review data is not discarded even if it is edited/deleted on GitHub, raw
information of comment contents and reactions are to be stored in community
repo. If the author edits/deletes their comment after it has been
meta-reviewed, they are destroying feedback from the community. This improper
behaviour will lead to a warning and a negative score given to them.

##### Display

Review comments that need meta-review will be displayed on a separate column
on gh-board. There are two approaches:

1. A basic version is to store the identifier of the PR comments which
   do not have meta-reviews and gh-board links to the PR review comment
   in GitHub PR web app. Doing it on GitHub has the benefit of letting users
   have their usual tools, e.g.
   [refined-github](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github).

2. In the ultimate version, gh-board would show the review comments.
   In the future, people could do meta-reviews directly on gh-board. This also
   provides an approach to doing meta-reviews anonymously.

#### Performance Requirements

Currently,
[fetch-issues.js](https://github.com/coala/gh-board/blob/46f1ad5ce83d5d72aa95ea00703b92c2fc38b2dc/script/fetch-issues.js)
pre-fetches issues and pull requests to speed up gh-board performance and
save users' API hits. Meta-reviews are also to be fetched during this procedure.

#### Other Features

The GSoC project provides a blueprint for future enhancement. Additional
features could be implemented to make the meta-review system more
sophisticated:

1. A basic ranking list will be built first. In the best case, we should
   offer an overall ranking list as well as a recent ranking list.

2. Offer an option for users to do meta-reviews directly on gh-board. In the
   future users can do meta-reviews on gh-board anonymously (currently, there
   is no way for people to do anonymous meta-reviews on GitHub page). Note
   that people may need context to do meta-reviews. The diff hunk to which
   the comment applies needs to be displayed on gh-board so that people have
   a basic context to do meta-reviews directly on gh-board.

3. Display visitor‚Äôs own meta-reviews if the visitor logs in. People may want
   to see meta-reviews they have done before.

4. Provide notifications of meta-reviews to a user if they receive any
   meta-review. Suppose I ask for someone's agreement and they use üëç to
   show their agreement, but I wouldn't receive any notification. I have to
   check that page regularly. gh-board is a nice place to provide notifications
   of meta-reviews.

5. There is a potential for reverted commits to be meta-reviewed. A reverted
   commit should trigger a new meta-review of the original PR, as time may
   have proved that the merge was incorrect, or maybe the merge was a
   self-aware time-sensitive workaround, and is no longer needed.

6. An important technical detail of meta-review in coala on GitHub is that
   the context disappears on an amend push, so meta-review by maintainers after
   the merge may be without the necessary context to be properly evaluated.
   However, if the commit SHA is mentioned, GitHub will keep the commit even
   if it is no longer in the PR. A gitmate plugin is needed in the future to
   mention any SHAs which have been reviewed, so that meta-reviews by
   maintainers will have more context and be more effective.

7. The UI of gh-board could have factual aggregated statistical information
   like how many of each emoji a person has given/received, again with a legend
   explaining their intended meanings, but without trying to aggregate across
   the different reaction types. Note that this information should not be
   displayed as a column, but as a manager-ish page like the
   [Burnup Chart](https://coala.github.io/gh-board/#/r/coala:coala%7Ccoala-bears%7Cdocumentation%7Ccorobo/burnup).
