## Abstract

This cEP describes the detailed implementation of a profiling interface as a
part of the
[GSoC'18 project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6109762077327360).

## Introduction

Profiling a Python program is a form of dynamic analysis that measures the
execution time of the program and the functions it is composed of. Its goal is
to produce data about where program is spending time and what area might
be worth optimizing. Thus we can provide a *Profiling interface* from within
coala and make it available to bear writers so that they can create better
performant bears.

This cEP proposes to introduce the profiling interface so that bear writers
will have the ability to Profile the Bear's code to optimize its
performance.

## Proposed Change

Bear writers can invoke the profiler with the `--profile-bears` argument.

Bear writer will have the ability to directly dump the raw
profile output (binary output) either on *current working directory* or to a
*specified directory name*, which can be further used for examination
of profiler stats with the help of different modules like
`pstats` or `snakeviz`.

- `--profile-bears` or `profile_bears` (using `.coafile`) is the main
  argument to enable profiling. It accepts an additional parameter
  `Dirname` through which bear writers can specify where to store the dump.

The profiler will start by profiling the `run()` method of bears
because it consumes most of the bears time. So, this is part where bear writer
will spend time, as rest of the part like loading the files, collecting the
settings, etc. are done by coala itself.

## Implementation Details

When user invokes the profiler with either *CLI* or by `coafile`
then the `execute` method of Bear base class will call the
`run_bear_from_section` method.

```python
def run_bear_from_section(self, args, kwargs):
  ...
  profile_bears = kwargs.get('profile_bears')
  if profile_bears is None:
      self.run(*args, **kwargs)
  else:
      self.profile(self.run, *args, **kwargs)
  ...
```

`run_bear_from_section` method checks whether bear writer invoke the profiler
interface or not i.e., keyword arguments passed to the Bear contain the
`profile_bears` key or not.

- If *not* then `run_bear_from_section()` method will directly call
  the `run()` method of Bear so that coala can continue its normal
  execution.
- Else `run_bear_from_section()` method will call `profile()` method which
  will check the whether the value of `profile_bears` key value is
  `True` or `Dirname`.

  - If `True` then `profile()` will create a profiler file for every
    bear of every section with a name `{section_name}_{bear_name}.prof` and
    dump it in a *current working directory.*

    ```python
    path = os.getcwd()
    if str(profile_bears)=='True':
        filename = '{}_{}.prof'.format(
            kwargs['section_name'], kwargs['bear_name'])
        open(filename, 'wb')
        kwargs.pop('section_name')
        kwargs.pop('bear_name')
        cProfile.runctx('self.run(*args, **kwargs)',
                        globals(), locals(), filename)
    ```

  - If `Dirname` then it check whether the specified directory exits or not.

    If exists then `profile()` method will create a profiler file for
    every bear of every section with a name `{section_name}_{bear_name}.prof`
    and dumps it on the directory `Dirname`.

    If not then it will create a directory with the literal name `Dirname` and
    dump then profiler files on that.

    ```python
    subdir = str(profile_dump)
    filepath = os.path.join(path, subdir)
    if os.path.isdir(filepath):
        filename = '{}_{}.prof'.format(
            kwargs['section_name'], kwargs['bear_name'])
        open(os.path.join(filepath,filename), 'wb')
        kwargs.pop('section_name')
        kwargs.pop('bear_name')
        cProfile.runctx('self.run(*args, **kwargs)',
                        globals(), locals(), os.path.join(filepath, filename))
    else:
        os.mkdir(os.path.join(path, subdir))
        filename = '{}_{}.prof'.format(
            kwargs['section_name'], kwargs['bear_name'])
        open(os.path.join(filepath,filename), 'wb')
        kwargs.pop('section_name')
        kwargs.pop('bear_name')
        cProfile.runctx('self.run(*args, **kwargs)',
                        globals(), locals(), os.path.join(filepath, filename))
    ```

## Profiler Output

A profiler produces a binary output that will contain a set of statistics that
describes how often and for how long various parts of the program executed.
These statistics can be formatted into reports via the `pstats` module or
by using third party tools like *SnakeViz*.
These formatted reports will help bear writers in creating a better
performant bear by analysing the profiler output.

For e.g.

With *CLI* arguments

```console
coala --b PEPE8Bear --files <file.py> --profile-bears
```

It will create a profile file with name `cli_PEP8Bear`.
and after that Bear writers can use different modules like
`pstats` or `snakeviz`, which reads profile results from a
file and formats them in various ways i.e.

- Using **pstats :**

  `pstats` has a simple line-oriented interface (implemented using cmd).
  A `pstats` module is a part of core Python.
  So, anyone can with a direct import `pstats` and start working with it.

  An example of how to generate a formatted output using `pstats` module
  and manipulate the profiler data using different methods of `psats`, like
  `strip_dirs()`, `sort_stats('cumtime')`. Here `strip_dirs()` remove the
  extraneous path from all the module names and `sort_stats('cumtime')` sort
  the output by cumulative time spent in this and all subfunctions
  (from invocation till exit).

  ```python
  >>> import pstats
  >>> ps = pstats.Stats('cli_PEP8Bear.prof')
  >>> ps.strip_dirs().sort_stats('cumtime').print_stats(5)
  Thu May 31 00:16:03 2018    python_PEP8Bear.prof

         7 function calls in 0.000 seconds

   Ordered by: cumulative time
   List reduced from 6 to 5 due to restriction <5>

   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {built-in method builtins.exec}
        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 <string>:1(<module>)
        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 __init__.py:111(wrapping_function)
        2    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {method 'get' of 'dict' objects}
        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 PEP8Bear.py:22(run)

    <pstats.Stats object at 0x7f2e69028a90>
  ```

- Using **SnakeViz:**

  *SnakeViz* is a browser based graphical viewer for the output of
  Python’s `cProfile` module. *SnakeViz* creates sunburst and icicle diagrams
  using profiler data as input. Using *sunburst* diagram *Snakeviz*
  represent the amount of time spent inside a function as a angular width
  of the arc.

  Sometimes functions don’t just spend time calling other functions, they also
  have their own internal time. SnakeViz shows this by putting a special child
  on each node that represents internal time.

  *SnakeViz* also provide a **Funtion Info** functionality in which it
  display a list of information about function like *function name*,
  *Cumulative Time*, *name of the file in which the function is defined*,
  *line number on which the function is defined*, *Directory of a flle*.

  For more information about *SnakeViz*,
  check this [link.](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/)

   *SnakeViz* is available
  on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/snakeviz/). Install with pip i.e.

  ```console
  $ pip install snakeviz
  ```

  Start *SnakeViz* from the command line i.e.

  ```console
  $ snakeviz cli_PEP8Bear.prof
  ```
