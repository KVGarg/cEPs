## Abstract

This document describes coala process rules which will be enforced by the
`GitCommitBear`.

## Introduction

`GitCommitBear` at present performs a check on the content of regular
commits made in a repository that includes performing checks on the shortlog and
body of commits. However, there are some cases that need to be taken care
of separately.

One such case is that of "GitHub Pull Request temporary merge commits". These
commits are automatically created by GitHub in `refs/pull/(\d+)/merge` git
remote reference. The `GitCommitBear` does not identify them at present and
fails causing the Travis CI build for corresponding PR to fail as well. Ideally
the `GitCommitBear` should run on the parent of this merge commit.

Also, there are many special types of commit messages that should be used only
in conjunction with patches containing a special type of content.

For example, `git revert` commit which is used to revert any previous commit and
`git merge` commit which is generated whenever someone performs a GitHub rebase
and tries to merge master onto the pull request. Rebase and merge on GitHub will
always update the committer information and create new commit SHAs which is not
correct. These commits generate a default commit message that is very concise
and not according to coalaâ€™s standards. The coala project wants to allow
`git revert` commits, but does not want to accept `git merge` commits as the
repositories are strictly fast-forward merges that do not have an extra commit.

In cases where some tests are not required by any pull request made to coala,
some special sequences can be added to git commit messages to instruct tools to
operate in a certain way.

This project is about detecting such commits and verifying that they are correct
according to the configuration settings in `.coafile`

## Background

`.coafile` is a project-wide coala configuration file which is used to specify
what is checked with which bears for a project.

The workaround that coala uses currently to handle the problem of GitHub Pull
Request temporary merge commits in `travis.yml` is:

```
if [[ "$TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST" != "false" ]]; then
  sed -e '/bears = GitCommitBear/d' .coafile > .coafile.new
  mv .coafile.new .coafile
fi
```

Below are some code snippets of `.coafile` from different projects depicting
their use of `GitCommitBear`.

## Proposed Change

This project would allow organizations to customize the `.coafile`
to allow following settings in the `[commit]` section.

```
[commit]
bears = GitCommitBear, CISkipInspectBear, GitMergeInspectBear, GitRevertInspectBear
allow_skip_ci_build = False
allow_git_merge_commit = False
allow_git_revert_commit = True
```

GitHub Pull Request temporary merge commits would be inspected by making
changes in the `GitCommitBear`. For other special commits, a meta bear
called `VCSCommitBear` would be used to provide information about the HEAD
commit like commit message, commit SHA, type of commit and list of modified,
added and delete files as `HiddenResult` which will be used be other bears
for inspection of each special commit separately.

Here is the detailed implementation stepwise:

1. We start by identifying different types of special commits namely GitHub Pull
   Request temporary merge commits, `git revert` , `git merge` and commits that
   disable CI builds.
2. Each type of commit is then handled as a separate case.
3. For GitHub Pull Request temporary merge commits:
   - As a solution to this problem, settings will be added in `GitCommitBear`
     that would identify GitHub Pull Request temporary merge commits and ignore
     them.
   - `GitCommitBear` would identify and check contents of the unmerged parent of
     these merge commits.
4. A meta bear called `VCSCommitBear` would be created that would return a
   `CommitResult` comprising of a tuple that will contain information about
   the type of git commit, commit sha, list of parent commits and lists of
   modified files, added and deleted files.
   This meta bear would be used to inspect each type of special commit.
5. For commits that disable CI builds:
   This would involve making a new bear named `CISkipInspectBear` to inspect
   commits that disable CI builds. This bear would contain metadata about
   various CI providers that are supported by the project such as Circle CI,
   Travis CI, Semaphore CI etc. Most of the CI providers use sequences like
   `[ci skip]` and `[skip ci]` for skipping CI build on commits. CI build
   don't occur for commits that have either of these sequences anywhere in
   the commit message.
   This bear would inspect the changes made in such commits and verify that they
   can skip CI build that is with respect to modified files and whether the
   corresponding CI engine allows skipping build or not. An appropriate message
   is returned if skipping build is not supported.
   - The commit message of HEAD commit as returned by `VCSCommitBear` is checked
     to see if it tries to escape CI build. If yes, the HEAD commit is inspected
     further, otherwise return.
   - Files modified in the commit should include files that are not covered by
     `.coafile` or tests. If this is not the case, an error is raised to exclude
     `[ci skip]` or `[skip ci]` from the commit message.
6. For merge commits:
   - If the commit type from the output of `VCSCommitBear` indicates that the
     commit is a `git merge` commit, inspection is done in `GitMergeInspectBear`
     otherwise return.
   - `GitMergeInspectBear` will be used by finding if the commit tries to merge
     master or any other branch onto the pull request. A message is displayed to
     perform a `git rebase` instead in such case.
7. For revert commits:
   - The commit message of HEAD commit as returned by `VCSCommitBear` is checked
     to see if it is a `git revert` commit. If yes, the HEAD commit is inspected
     further, otherwise return.
   - In `GitRevertInspectBear`, the patches of both commits are compared to
     ensure that they are in fact reverse of each other. Minor differences are
     allowed.
   - In case of total mismatch, a note in the commit message highlighting that
     it is not a clean revert is expected.
   - A message suggesting improvements in the commit message is displayed.
