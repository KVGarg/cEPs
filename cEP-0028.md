## Abstract

This cEP describes the optimizations that need to be carried out
to improve the performance of the coala based language server.

## Introduction

Language servers are the tools used to serve code editors with
functionalities such as linting, code fixing, analysis etc in a
standalone and independent manner. coala as a code style checker,
linter and code fixer could be a powerful tool to be integrated
into the code editor.

Code Editing is a continuous process and the editors are expected
to provide feedback on the fly, coala on the other hand was primarily
designed as an analysis tool to be used after an incremental update to
the codebase. Thus, the current implementation of a coala language
server is severely limited by coala's performance.

The performance of the server can be improved by primarily optimizing
the coala and language server interface and improving the bear
configuration options to avoid long running bears.

## Proposal

The optimization process focuses to maintain minimal changes to coala
core and rather optimize the coala and language server interface. The
following are the proposed ideas.

- Section Tagging

  Some sections are not often required to be executed on every cycle of
  coala analysis especially during use cases such as this. The parameter
  set can thus be extended to support a new parameter named `tags`. Since
  these parameters are not associated with any particular bear but rather
  control the effect of various sections during executing coala, no support
  extension for bears would be necessary. These parameters enable support
  for hooking a section for a particular tag type. For example:

  ```
  [longrunning]
  tags = save, change
  enabled = True
  bears = SomeLongRunningBear
  ```

  This kind of a configuration will enable this section during analysis
  cycles of coala via a language server when a save or change request is
  raised while not impacting any untagged regular invocations.

  ```
  [longrunning]
  tags = save
  files = *.py
  bears = SomeLongRunningBear

  [longrunning.some]
  tags += change
  bears = SomeLongRunningBear
  ```

  This example shows a case where the sections inherit the tags and
  thereby `longrunning.some` runs on both `save` and `change` tagged
  execution cycles.

  To enable tagged executional support, coala-core needs to be extended
  and the existing `--filter-by` cli option will need to support runtime
  section filtering. A new filter will have to be introduced named
  `section_tags`. The execution of sections will then be based upon tags
  passed to `--filter-by section_tags`. This extension of support for
  `tags` would require at least the following changes:

  - `coalib.parsing.filters.SectionTagsFilter`

    Adds a new section filter to the to check if the
    section/bear should be enabled for a particular
    tag based invocation.

    ```python
    def section_tags_filter(section_or_bear, args):
      """
      Filters the bears or sections by ``tags``.
      :param section_or_bear: A section or bear instance on which filtering
                              needs to be carried out.
      :param args:            Set of tags on which it needs to be filtered.
      :return:                ``True`` if this instance matches the criteria
                              inside args, ``False`` otherwise.
      """
      enabled_tags = list(map(str.lower, args))
      if len(enabled_tags) == 0:
        return True

      section = section_or_bear
      if hasattr(section_or_bear, 'section'):
        # If it is a bear or bear like object it has
        # to have an associated section which contains
        # all settings, including tags.
        section = section_or_bear.section

      section_tags = section.get('tags', False)
      if str(section_tags) == 'False':
        return False

      section_tags = map(str.lower, section_tags)
      return bool(set(section_tags) & set(enabled_tags))
    ```

  - `coalib.coala_main.run_coala`

    Enhance `run_coala()` to check if the corresponding tags
    of the sections are enabled.

    ```python
    # Collect all the filters and try to filter sections
    filters = collect_filters(args, arg_list, arg_parser)
    if len(filters) > 0:
      all_sections = list(sections.values())
      try:
        filtered = apply_filters(filters, sections=all_sections)
        sections = OrderedDict(
            (sect.name.lower(), sect) for sect in filtered)
      except (InvalidFilterException, NotImplementedError) as ex:
        console_printer.print(ex)
    ```

  ### Supported Tags

  The following are the tags that shall be used by coala-ls to trigger
  sections that need to be run on corresponding request types, these
  tagged sections can also be used by any other editor plugin to serve
  similar functionality.

  - `open`: Tag group to execute during a open event on a file.

  - `change`: Tag group to execute during a change event on the
              project files in an editor.

  - `save`: Tag group to execute on a save event on the project files.

  - `format`: Tag group to execute when a `formatting` event is
    raised on a file.

- Custom entry point into coala core

  Since coala core was not designed to be a long running process coalib
  does not provide a flexible entry point into it. To maximize the
  efficiency of coala language server, it will require an entry
  point that supports:

  - `FileProxies`: Not all changes on the editor are flushed
    to the disk, coala core will have to support processing file
    contents directly as opposed to files. This can be achieved
    using FileProxies which provide a gateway to files and their
    in-memory counterparts.

  Support for `FileProxies` can be introduced by extending FileCaches
  to additionally provide file content generating/reading methods.
  The following functions are core to the implementation and API of
  coala and need to be patched or extended to bring support for
  coala-ls.

  - `coalib.io.FileProxy`

    Addition of a FileProxy class.

  - `coalib.processes.Processing.instantiate_processes()`

    Enhance `instantiate_processes()` to conditionally make
    use of cache instance to generate file dict or use default.

    ```python
    # generate file dict from a cache or use the default
    # generator in case caching is disabled/unavailable.
    file_dict_gen = get_file_dict if cache is None else cache.get_file_dict
    complete_file_dict = file_dict_gen(complete_filename_list,
                                       allow_raw_files=use_raw_files)
    ```

  - `coalib.coala_main.run_coala()`

    Requires changes to function signatures and addition of `cache`
    parameter with a default value of `None` to be passed down upwards.

## Known Issues

- Currently, because the support for in-memory analysis has to come as
  part of FileCaches, FileProxies cannot be used when caching is disabled.
