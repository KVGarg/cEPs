## Abstract

This cEP proposes a framework for coala-quickstart to generate more relevant
`.coafile` sections based on project files and user preferences.

## Current flow of coala-quickstart

- Find all the files from the project directory, check `.gitignore` for files to
  ignore.
- Get the languages used in the project and their percentage from file
  extensions.
- Filter bears based on the languages used in the project and [curated
  sets](https://github.com/coala/coala-quickstart/blob/master/coala_quickstart/Constants.py#L1)
  of important bears.
- Generate a `.coafile` by creating a section for each language, adding filtered
  bears corresponding to the language, and prompting the user for non-optional
  settings.

## Objectives

This first objective involves modifying the existing `filter_relevant_bears`
method in the Bears module in coala-quickstart to select and filter bears based
on:

- Languages detected in the project.
- Linters already used by the project.
- The current `IMPORTANT_BEARS_LIST` in
  [`Constants.py`](https://github.com/coala/coala-quickstart/blob/master/coala_quickstart/Constants.py)
- Information provided by users regarding the capabilities (`CAN_DETECT`,
  `CAN_FIX` labels)
- Installed bear dependencies

The second objective involves filling in the setting values for `.coafile`
sections.

## Process

### Categorizing the files from which the information is extracted.

Based on the information they may provide, the target files of `InfoExtractor`
classes can be categorized into following two categories:

1. Dependency files (Examples: `package.json`, `requirements.txt` and `Gemfile`)
2. Setting-values file (Examples: `.editorconfig`, `.gitignore` and
   `.csslintrc`)

Some files might belong both the categories (like `Gruntfile.js` and
`Gulpfile.js`).

The dependency files can be used to prompt users to activate certain Bears if
all the dependencies in Bear's `REQUIREMENT` field are present in the dependency
files. The setting-values files, on the other hand, are used to fill in the
settings of the Bears and to detect conflicting configurations in the project.

Both categories of files, taken together, can complement each other to provide a
scenario where "A dependency file finds BearA that can be activated, and the
settings of BearA are derived by the information extracted from setting-values
files" thereby automating the complete section generation process in some cases.

### Collecting the meta-data

This section explains the meta-data that is required to be collected for
filtering bears and generating sections. The data to be collected at runtime is
as follows:

1. Inverse Mappings of requirement types to the bears.


```
REQUIREMENTS_META = {
    “requirement_name” : {
        “requirement_type” : NpmRequirement,
        "version" : ">=0.4.2"
        “bears” : [ list, of, bears, wrapping, the, executable],
    }
}
```

This will be used to match against the `ProjectDependencyInfo` extracted from
the project. In the case of a match, the corresponding bears may be suggested to
the user.

2. Mapping of language and the corresponding Bears available in coala-bears.


```
{
    "language_1": ["Bear1", "Bear2"],
    "language_2": ["Bear3", "Bear4"]
}
```

This will be generated at the runtime and will be used to filter bears based on
languages used in the project.

3. Inverse Mappings of the `CAN_DETECT` and `CAN_FIX` capabilities metadata
   provided in the bears to the name of the bears. Example:


```
CAPABILITIES_MAP = {
    “capability_name” : {
        "lanaguage_name": {
            "DETECT": [bears, that, can, detect, the, capability, for, the, language]
            "FIX": [bears, that, can, fix, the, capability, for, the, language]
        },
    },
}
```

The users will be prompted to pick the desired capabilities in the beginning via
the CLI,  relevant bears are selected (with non-overlapping capabilities) and
become part of the final generated `.coafile`. In future, these labels can be
replaced or complemented by `DETECT_ASPECTS` and `FIX_ASPECTS` to enable users
to provide their choices for "aspects" while selecting the bears.

4. Unified represenation of information extracted from `InfoExtractors` for
   project files like `.editorconfig`, `Gruntfile.js`, `package.json`,
   `.csslintrc`, etc (see this
   [issue](https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC-2017/issues/21) and
   [cEP-0009](https://github.com/coala/cEPs/blob/master/cEP-0009.md) for more
   details)


```
{
    "info_name": [InfoInstance1, InfoInstance2,]
}
```

The `Info` instances encapsulate the extracted information from project files.
The various kinds of `Info` classes will be utilized on case-by-case basis.
Example, `IgnorePathsInfo` may be used to exclude files from analysis right from
the beginning, `ProjectDependencyInfo` might be used to match against the
`REQUIREMENTS_META` discussed in point 1, `StyleInfo` may provide values to fill
inside the generated `.coafile` sections.

5. Mechanism to extract all the non-optional settings of a Bear at the runtime.

### Filtering and selecting bears from collected metadata

This section discusses the step-by-step procedure of selecting relevant bears
and then creating `.coafile` sections from them.

1. Identify all the languages used in the project.

2. Ask users to select capabilities based on possible `CAN_DETECT` and `CAN_FIX`
   label values. Store them in a list `desired_capabilities` like:


```
desired_capabilities = ["capability1", "capabilty2"]
```

The "FIX" capabilites are stricter than "DETECT" capabilities. If a Bear has a
capability to fix some aspect, it is obvious that it has capability to detect
it. This fact will be taken into account while filtering bears by capabilities
at a later step. The `desired_capabilities` list may also be pre-populated with
some important capabilities (on similar lines as the existing
[IMPORTANT_BEARS_LIST](https://github.com/coala/coala-quickstart/blob/master/coala_quickstart/Constants.py#L1))

3. Generate a dictionary named `candidate_bears` of the form


```
candidate_bears = {
    "detected_language_1": {"BearA", "BearB"},
    "detected_language_2": {"BearB", "BearD"},
    "all": {"BearE", "BearF", "BearG"}
}
```

It is possible to have overlap among the lists in `candidate_bears` which will
be resolved at later stage.

4. Initialize empty dictionary named `to_propose_bears`.

5. Initialize a dictionary named `selected_bears` to `IMPORTANT_BEARS_LIST`.

6. Given the metadata mentioned in the previous section is available, filter the
   `candidate_bears` lists as:

   1. Remove those bears from `candidate_bears` which do not contain any of the
      capability in `desired_capabilites` set.
   2. Among the remaining bears in `candidate_bears`, if some
      `ProjectDependenyInfo` extracted from the project matches the
      `REQUIREMENTS` field of bear (matching might also involve checking the
      compatibility of semvers), move the tuple `(Info, Bear)` to
      `to_propose_bears`.

7. For every bear in `to_propose_bears`:

   1. If there's enough extracted information from the project to fill in all
      the non-optional settings of the Bear, move the Bear to `selected_bears`
      list.
   2. Else, prompt the user on CLI with the evidence (the source of  `Info`
      instance in the tuple) to enable the bear. If the user agrees, move the
      bear to `selected_bears`, otherwise discard the bear.

8. For each of the remaining bears in `candidate_bears`, eliminate bears having
   capabilities already satisfied in `selected_bears`.

9. Among the remaining bears in `candidate_bears`, in the case of conflicts in
   capabilities among the bears in the list:

   1. Eliminate bears having no unique capabilities among the other bears
      present in the list.
   2. Give preference to the bears already having dependencies installed (using
      the `check_prerequisites` field of the bears) and eliminate the
      respective conflicting bears.
   3. Add the remaining bears to `selected_bears` list.

10. For every non-optional setting of each bear `selected_bears` object,

    1. If the setting's value exists in extracted information, do nothing.
    2. Else,
       1. If the quickstart is being executed in interactive mode, prompt the
          user for the setting value.
       2. If non-interactive mode, discard the bear.

11. Finally, create sections from the `selected_bears` list using the collected
    information values from user inputs and project files.

In future, more constraints can be added to further narrow down the list of
selected bears by giving users more flexibility in terms of options like
`max_bears`, `max_bears_per_language`, `exclude_languages`, etc.

### Mapping extracted information to setting values.

To automatically fill in some of the setting values in `.coafile` sections, the
`Info` classes need to be mapped to settings values of the Bears. These scope of
applicability of these `Info` instances may vary from "bear-specific", to
"section" to "global". The scope for a mapping may be defined based on the:

- Source of the `Info` instance
- Value of the `Info` instance
- Class of the `Info` instance
- Any other attribute encapsulated in the `Info` instance

The scope of the information can be represented by the `InfoScope` class as
follows:

```py
class InfoScope:
    def __init__(self,
                 level,
                 sections=[],
                 bears=[],
                 allowed_sources=[],
                 allowed_extractors=[]):
        """
        A class representing scope of applicability of an
        ``Info`` instance.

        :param level:              Broad-level scope, possible values are
                                   "global", "section", and "bear".
        :param sections:           list of section names, considered only for
                                   the ``level`` "section" and "bear".
        :param bears:              list of bear names, considered only for the
                                   "bear" ``level``.
        :param allowed_sources:    list containing names of the sources of
                                   ``Info`` classes which fall within this

                                   instance is applicable for all the sources.
        :param allowed_extractors: list of allowed ``InfoExtractor`` derived
                                   classes for the scope.
        """
        self.level = level
        if level=="sections":
            self.sections = sections
        elif level=="bears":
            self.sections = sections
            self.bears = bears
        self.allowed_sources = allowed_sources
        self.allowed_extractors = allowed_ extractors

    def check_belongs_to_scope(self,
                               section_name,
                               bear_name):
        """
        Checks if the given section_name and bear_name
        belong to the InfoScope or not.
        """
        if self.level=="global":
            return True
        elif self.level=="sections":
            if section_name in self.sections:
                return True
        elif self.level=="sections":
            if (section_name in self.sections and
                bear_name in self.bears):
                return True
        return False

    def check_is_applicable_information(self, info):
        """
        Checks if the given ``Info`` instance contains
        information applicable to the InfoScope of not.
        """
        if (info.source in self.allowed_sources or
            is_instance(info.extractor, self.allowed_extractors)):
            return True
        return False
```

The `InfoScope` instances serve following two purposes while trying to fill an
extracted information value to a setting based on mapping:

1. Check if the mapping if applicable for a given bear and a given section.
2. Check if the `Info` instance is valid based on its extraction source and
   the extractor class.

The mappings will be defined similar to the following way:

```py
INFO_SETTING_MAPS = {
    "setting_key_1": [
            {
                "scope": InfoScope(level="global"),
                "info_kind": SomeInfoClass,
                "mapper_function": function_to_map_value_in_info_to_setting_value
            },
            {
                "scope": InfoScope(level="bear",
                                   bears=["SomeBear"]),
                "info_kind": AnotherInfoClass,
                "mapper_function": function_to_map_value_in_info_to_setting_value
            },
        ],

    "setting_key_2": [
            {
                "scope": InfoScope(level="sections",
                                   sections=["python"]),
                "info_kind": InfoClassA,
                "mapper_function": function_to_map_value_in_info_to_setting_value
            },
        ],

    "ignore": [
            {
                "scope": InfoScope(level="global"),
                "info_kind": IgnorePathsInfo,
                "mapper_function": lambda x: x if is_valid_glob(x)
            }
    ]
}
```

The mappings will be stored in a module named `InfoMappings.py` in
coala-quickstart inside the `info_extraction` package.

#### Filling-in the values of bear settings

An attempt to autofill the setting's value can be made before prompting the user
to fill the values. This can be done as follows:

```py
def autofill_value_if_possible(self,
                               setting_key,
                               section,
                               bear,
                               extracted_information):
    """
    For the given setting configurations, checks if there is a possiblity of filling it's value from the extracted information, and returns the values if they are applicable.
    """
    if INFO_SETTING_MAPS.get(setting_name):
        for mapping in INFO_SETTING_MAPS[setting_key]:
            scope = mapping["scope"]
            if (scope.check_belongs_to_scope(
                    section, bear)):
                # look for the values in extracted information
                # from all the ``InfoExtractor`` instances.
                values = extracted_information.get(mapping["info_kind"])
                for val in values:
                    if scope.check_is_applicable_information(val):
                        yield val
    return None
```

#### Detecting inconsistencies in project configurations

Another interesting application of the unified representation of
extracted-information is detecting the inconsistencies among different project
configurations. The intra-scope conflicts due to different Info from different
sources can be brought up to users consideration. The inter-scope conflicts can
be fixed either based on level-priority (global &lt; section &lt; bear) or by
prompting users to select their preferred value.

The inconsistencies can be detected as

```py
to_fill_values = list(autofill_value_if_possible(some_setting,
                                                 some_section,
                                                 some_bear))
if len(to_fill_values) > 1:
    # warn the user about inconsistency.
```

The inconsistencies need to be resolved before using the `Info` values to fill
in the settings of `.coafile` sections. As a simple solution, user can be
prompted like

```
> We found conflicting options in your file_a and your file_b, which should assume dominance?
1. file_a
2. file_b
3. override both and specify your value
```

### Overall effect on coala-quickstart's CLI and outputs

After the bears are filtered, and relevant information has been extracted out of
the projects, the users are notified, a more tailored version of coafile is
written. The per-language sections are generated like before, but with some
additional bears included based on relevant information discovered from project
and user's preference (CLI input). The users are also prompted for the values
like before, but an attempt is made to autofill these values before prompting
the users. If there are multiple possible values to autofill, such
inconsistencies are brought to user's consideration allowing him to pick any one
or them or override all of them.

#### Running mode options for quickstart

- Robust mode (activate all the bears)
- Non-interactive mode (choose the best `.coafile` without user interference)
  - With default capabilities. (default option for non-interactive modes)
  - Without any predefined capabilities.
- Interactive mode (prompt for setting values)
  - With user provided capabilities. (default option for interactive mode)
  - With default capabilities.
  - Without capabilities.

There will be a `filter_by_capabilties` option which will be prompted to users
in normal mode. In non-interactive mode, a command line flag
`--no-default-capabilities` can be passed to disable filtering by
default_capabilities.  In case the `filter_by_capabilties` option is disabled,
steps 8,9 and 10 in "Filtering and selecting bears from collected meta-data"
section will be skipped.

A possible set of deault capabilties can be:

- Syntax
- Formatting
- Documentation
- Spelling
- Code Simplification
- Smell
- Redundancy

##### An example flow for the interactive mode

1. The user runs coala-quickstart and specifies project directories.
2. Languages are identified in the project.
3. All the `InfoExtractor` classes are instantiated, and the extracted
   information is aggregated and stored.
4. The user is asked if he wants to select bears based on capabilities.
5. The filtering and selection of bears take place as described in sections
   above.
6. After the bears are selected for every language present in the project,
   coala-quickstart tries automatically to fill the setting values for the
   bears, failing which, the user is prompted for the value. In case some
   inconsistency is encountered here, it is brought to user's consideration.
7. The per-language sections are generated, and final `.coafile` is written.

##### An example flow for the non-interactive mode

1. The user runs coala-quickstart and specifies project directories.
2. Languages are identified in the project.
3. All the `InfoExtractor` classes are instantiated, and the extracted
   information is aggregated and stored.
4. The filtering and selection of bears take place as described in sections
   above.
5. After the bears are selected for every language present in the project,
   coala-quickstart tries automatically to fill the setting values for the
   bears, failing which, the bear is discarded. In case some inconsistency is
   encountered here, an attempt is made to resolve it based on scope, failing
   which, the bear may be discarded, or any one of the possible value is filled
   in with a warning comment.
6. The per-language sections are generated, and final `.coafile` is written.
