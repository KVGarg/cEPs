## Abstract

This is a proposal on how to decentralize the management of coala by
introducing teams.

## Structure

A team is a self organizing group that is responsible for a certain
aspect of coala. Code reviews should be done internally or in
cooperation with the review team.

To support this self organization, issues in the coala scope
shall have a label corresponding with one of the existing Teams. If a
member finds an issue without such a label, a fitting one shall be set.

## Teams

Teams are organized in the [coala/teams](https://github.com/coala/teams)
repository.

A new team can be proposed explicit via an issue/pr or implicit via an
application for a matching Team Leader.

## Roles

A coala team consists of the following roles:

### Team Leader

Every team has one Team Leader.
The Team Leader is the main organizer of the team. Their job is not to do
the team's work, but to make sure that everyone knows their tasks. The
Team Leader is also a Team Member.

At any time there may be no more than two Team Leaders from the same
company across all teams.

Leaders may resign at any point. Reelections are held if the end of the
term is further away than a month.

### Team Member

A Team Member agrees to focus their work on the aspect the teams is
assigned to. It is possible for a coala member to be part of multiple
teams.
Team Members are responsible to work on issues that fit their domain
and review pull requests from their team members.

Team Members, excluding Team Leaders, have to apply to the
corresponding Team Leader and their acceptance represents a B Level
Decision as proposed in cEP-0001 with the addition that one of the
involved voters has to be the corresponding Team Leader.

## Electing Team Leaders

Any coala member may propose him or herself to be a Team Leader. The
proposal should be public and include reasons and plans to take that
particular team forward. (Archived in the wiki.)
The applications must be submit to the
[coala/teams](https://github.com/coala/teams) repository.

Elections for Team Leaders represent a C Level Decision as specified in
cEP-0001 and are done once a year. In addition to the rules specified in
cEP-0001 the votes are cast in secret.

**The election for the first term will be held from 2016.12.16 to 2016.12.23
and counted on 2016.12.24. The term starts after the evaluation of the votes
is done.
Dates are 00:00 GMT**

## Voting on Teams

The decision to create a new Team represents a B Level Decision as
specified in cEP-0001 and can be done any time.

The decision to close a Team represents a C Level Decision as specified
in cEP-0001 and is done once a year together with the Team Leaders
elections.
