## Abstract

This cEP describes the improvements to IGitt and Gitmate, which include
upgrading dependencies, making it functional, changes to plugins, etc. as a
part of the [GSoC'21 project][1].

## Introduction

Gitmate, a git workflow management bot created by coala, hasn't been actively
maintained in the last 3 years. It needs to be updated it and brought back to
active use. Various improvements need to be made to Gitmate as well as IGitt,
the underlying library that powers Gitmate's git operations.

## Upgrade Dependencies

IGitt and Gitmate are both severely outdated in terms of dependencies. Support
needs to be added for the latest versions of python, and most packages need to
be updated to their latest versions. IGitt is currently using Jira API v2 which
can be upgraded to v3. Currently, Angular is running v4. It needs fundamental
changes to upgrade it to v12.

## Changes to IGitt

- [Docstrings, wherever missing, need to be added to the IGitt
  codebase][2].
- IGitt documentation needs to be updated to reflect changes occurring due to
  migration from Gitmate to coala organisation. Also, a section can be added on
  how IGitt codebase is structured, examples can be written for those actions
  missing currently like notifications, reactions etc, and a section on how to
  use and set up and use for developers can be added too.
- Cron jobs are currently missing for different versions of python, so they
  need to be added after adding support for latest versions.
- coala-IGitt needs to be published as a separate package.

## Changes to Gitmate

### Fix CI/CD and make Gitmate functional

Firstly, cron jobs need to be added for all the supported versions of python.
Also, Gitmate hosting needs to be migrated to a new domain before we activate
Gitmate.

### Improve frontend

Multiple improvements can be made to the frontend. These include **UI changes**
such as:

- Remove the use of German
- Remove the list of sponsor companies
- Revamp landing page
- Fix 'copy plugin settings': dropdown should not show 'suggested password'
- Make spinner go away after activating gitmate on a repository
- Fix buggy slide toggles
- [Fix alignment of toggles for suboptions][3]
- Allow user to go to ‘/repo/n’ by click on repository card
- [Add repository name in title][4]
- [Use material chips in text areas][5]
- [Make ‘copy plugin’ bar longer][6]
- Improve design of repository cards

**Frontend documentation** can be improved and the following changes can be
made:

- Improve developers section - Fix broken links, improve part about setting
  environment variables
- Complete FAQ.md
- Add a section on how the Gitmate codebase is structured.

### Changes to backend

- Docstrings, wherever missing, need to be added to the backend codebase.
- The **‘ack’**, **‘approver’**, and **‘auto label pending or wip’ plugins**
  need to be merged into [a][7] [combined][8] ['review'][9] [plugin][10].
  The models for the combined review plugins should be similar to this:

```python
class Settings(SettingsBase):
    wip_label = models.CharField(
        max_length=25,
        default='status/WIP',
        help_text='Label for pull requests that are work in progress')
    pending_review_label = models.CharField(
        max_length=25,
        default='status/pending_review',
        help_text='Label for pull requests that need review')
    approved_label = models.CharField(
        max_length=25,
        default='status/approved',
        help_text='Label for pull requests that have been approved')
    ack_strs = models.TextField(
        default='ack, reack',
        help_text='Keywords for acknowledging commits, comma separated')
    unack_strs = models.TextField(
        default='unack',
        help_text='Keywords for unacknowledging commits, comma separated')
```

```python
class MergeRequestModel(models.Model):
    repo = models.ForeignKey(
        Repository, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='review_mr')
    number = models.IntegerField()
    acks = psql_fields.JSONField(default=dict)
    head_sha = models.CharField(max_length=40, default='')

    @property
    def ack_state(self):
        state = CommitStatus(
            Status.SUCCESS, 'This PR is reviewed. :)',
            'review/gitmate/manual/pr', 'https://gitmate.io')
        for acked in dict(self.acks).values():
            if acked['status'] in [Status.FAILED.value,
                                   Status.ERROR.value,
                                   Status.CANCELED.value]:
                return CommitStatus(
                    Status.FAILED, 'This PR needs work. :(',
                    'review/gitmate/manual/pr', 'https://gitmate.io')
            if acked['status'] == Status.PENDING.value:
                state = CommitStatus(
                    Status.PENDING, 'This PR needs review.',
                    'review/gitmate/manual/pr', 'https://gitmate.io')

        return state

    @property
    def igitt_pr(self):
        return self.repo.igitt_repo.get_mr(self.number)
```
- The rebaser plugin needs to be changed to ensure that the [proper labels][11] are
  applied when rebase, fastforward, or merge is performed. The
  following functions must be added in `responders.py` of rebaser plugin:

```python
def verify_appropriate_label(cmd: str,
                             pr: MergeRequest,
                             wip_label: str = 'status/WIP',
                             pending_review_label: str = 'status/pending_review',
                             approved_label: str = 'status/approved'):
    if(cmd == 'rebase'):
        return True
    labels = pr.labels
    if not approved_label in labels:
        return False
```

```python
def handle_command_fail(pr: MergeRequest,
                        wip_label: str = 'status/WIP',
                        pending_review_label: str = 'status/pending_review',
                        approved_label: str = 'status/approved'):
    labels = pr.labels
    if not wip_label in labels:
        if pending_review_label in labels:
            labels.discard(pending_review_label)
        else:
            labels.discard(approved_label)
        labels.add(wip_label)
```
