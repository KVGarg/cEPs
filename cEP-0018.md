## Abstract

This document describes how an API based on ANTLR will be constructed and
maintained.

## Introduction

ANTLR provides parsers for various language grammars and thus we can provide
an interface from within coala and make it available to bear writers so that
they can write advanced linting bears. This will aim at supporting the more
flexible visitor based method of AST traversal (as opposed to listener based
mechanisms).

The proposal is to introduce a parallel concept to the coala-bears library,
which will be called `coala-antlr` hereon.

## Proposed Change

Here is the detailed implementation stepwise:

1. There will be a separate repository named as `coala-antlr` which will
   be installable via `pip install coala-antlr`.
2. A new package would be introduced in the coala-antlr repository,
   which would maintain all the dependencies for `antlr-ast` based
   bears. This would be the `coantlib` package
3. The `coantlib` package will provide endpoints relevant to the
   visitor model of traversing the ast generated via ANTLR.
4. Another package named `coantparsers` will be created inside
   `coala-antlr` repository. This package will hold parsers and lexers
   generated for various languages generated (with python target) beforehand
   for the supported set of grammars.
5. `coantlib` will have an `ASTLoader` class that will be responsible
   for loading the AST of a given file depending on the user input, using file
   extension as a fallback.
   For e.g, a .c file will be loaded using the parser from
   `coantlib` for c language if no language is specified.
6. Another `ASTWalker` class will be responsible for providing a single method
   to resolve the language supplied by the bear and create a walker instance
   of the appropriate type.
7. Also `coantlib.walkers` will have several walker classes derived from
   `ASTWalker` class that will be language specific and grammar dependant.
   For e.g a `Py3ASTWalker`.
8. The bears dependant on the `coantlib` will reside in the same repository as
   the `coantlib`. All of them will be in a different package, the `coantbears`
   package, all of them installable together via a single option in the
   setup.py along with `coantlib`.
9. The bears will be able to use a high level API by defining the `LANGUAGE`
   instance variable, which will return to them a walker with high level API's
   in case the language is supported. (for e.g if `LANGUAGE='Python'`, they
   will automatically get a `BasePyASTWalker` instance in the walker class
   variable)

## Management of the new `coala-antlr` repository

Managing a new repository is a heavy task, and this will be highly automated as
follows:

1. The parsers in `coala-antlr/coantparsers` would be generated and
   pushed via CI builds whenever a new commit is pushed.
2. The cib tool can be enhanced to deal with the installation of bears that
   require only some specified parsers (for e.g a `PyUnusedVarBear` would
   only require parser for python).
3. There will be nightly cron jobs for keeping parsers up-to-date.
4. For adding support for a new language, a new Walker class deriving
   `ASTWalker` would be added and the rest will be automatically taken care by
   the library.

## Code Samples/Prototypes

Here is a prototype for the implementations within `coantlib`:

```python
import antlr4
import coantparsers
import inspector

from antlr4 import InputStream
from coalib.bearlib.languages.definitions import *
from coalib.bearlib.languages.Language import parse_lang_str, Languages


def resolve_with_package_info(lang):
    """
    Use the inspector methods to search amongst all
    classes that inherit ASTWalker within this module
    and return that class whose supported language matches
    """


class ASTLoader(object):

    mapping = {
        C: [coantparsers.clexer, coantparsers.cparser],
        Python: [coantparsers.pylexer, coantparsers.pyparser],
        JavaScript: [coantparsers.jslexer, coantparsers.jsparser],
        ...
    }

    @staticmethod
    def load_file(file, filename, lang='auto'):
        """
        Loads file's AST into memory
        """
        if(lang == 'auto'):
            ext = get_extension(filename)
        else:
            ext = Languages(parse_lang_str(lang)[0])[0]
        if ext is None:
            raise FileExtensionNotSupported('Unknown File Type')
        inputStream = InputStream(''.join(file))
        lexer = mapping[ext][0](inputStream)
        parser = mapping[ext][1](lexer)
        return parser


class ASTWalker(object):
    treeRoot = None
    tree = None

    @staticmethod
    def make_walker():
        """
        Resolves walker object for appropriate type
        """
        if lang == 'auto':
            return ASTWalker
        else:
            return resolve_with_package_info(lang)

    @staticmethod
    def get_walker(file, filename, lang):
        """
        Returns a walker to the required language
        """
        ret_class = make_walker(lang)
        if not ret_class:
            raise Exception('Un-supported Language')
        else:
            return ret_class(file, filename)

    def __init__(file, filename):
        self.tree = ASTLoader.load_file(file, filename)
        self.treeRoot = self.tree
    ...
```

### Prototype of `Py3ASTWalker`

        since / and // are different in py3, this is py3 specific
        """

### Prototype of  `ASTBear` class implementation

            and yielding an apt result
            wherever required
