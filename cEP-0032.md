## Abstract

This document describes the features that will increase the usability and
easiness for all the open-source enthusiasts. And, that will be accomplished by
enhancing and improving the coala Community and Projects website for newcomers,
developers as well as for other communities. Also, new API Endpoints
will be implemented in coala Webservices where many of them will have their
respective *cron jobs*. *CRON Jobs* are necessary because it will help us to
keep the database up-to-date by regularly fetching the members contributions to
the organization, *Netlify* form submissions, and the activities happening
within the organization like new issues opened, etc. These new endpoints will
manage the organization database in a much more structured form.

## Introduction

A website always plays an essential role for an open-source community as it
spreads the idea of offerings that community provide to other organizations,
with information about its active community by telling about their skills as
well as about their precious contributions to the organization. And to provide
such offerings this project aims to provide useful features to contributors.
For contributors, who haven't been part of the organization can fill-up the
*Community Join Form*. The form submission will checked by performing some
checks, to validate whether you're eligible to be a member of the
organization or not. And for the organization members, some new below-mentioned
features will be implemented so as to make the tasks easier within the
organization, for example, getting assigned to an issue via a form. Information
about all the new features, are being explained in further sections.

## coala [Community website](https://community.coala.io/)

### Enhancements

The listed enhancements will ease the navigability and usability for newcomers,
developers and to all others who wanted to be a part of the organization.
Implementing these enhancements will give community members a glance about the
precious contributions made by you as well other contributors to
the organization. And, you can even view your contributions in the form of
*charts*. Following are the new enhancements that will be added to coala
community website:

1. **Display a web-page for -**
   1. **organization teams**

        This web-page will display information about the organization teams,
        and will be displayed to only authenticated users. It will definitely
        not show all the contributor's name, as we already have a web-page
        which displays the all the members of the organization. So, what
        will it show? It will definitely not show what permissions are
        available to team members. But, it will definitely provide information
        like *What does this team aim to do?*, *Members count*, and a count
        value which gives information about *'how many new members are being
        added to this team this week?'*. Clicking on any **team name** will
        redirect the user to either on GitHub showing all team members or a
        new web-page which will show all the team members of this team.

   2. **contributors' geolocation in the form of a map**

        Showing the *global influence of an organization* around the world of
        open-source organization's can be achieved by showing the contributors'
        geolocation. It can be shown in the form of a world map which displays
        the locations in the form of a cluster. Each cluster demonstrates a
        number of contributor's around the world, who have contributed to the
        organization in any manner. Only the organization members geolocation
        will be shown-up on the map, for now.

   3. **mentors**

        It will be good if community website can show-up all the potential
        mentors that an organization has. It will allow other organizations to
        get to know more about them.

2. **Add a Netlify form for -**
   1. adding a new calendar event,
   2. adding new Open-Source Google forms,
   3. adding details about your Google Summer of Code(GSoC) project,
   4. applying as a mentor in GSoC,
   5. joining the community (*newcomer form*),
   6. getting promoted to developer role(*Promotion to Developer form*), and
   7. Feedback

      Feedback ​from organization developers or users is necessary for every
      organization, therefore an addition of feedback form to community website
      will be very helpful.

   *Following Validation checks will be performed while:*
      1. **adding a contributor as a mentor**
         * Participated in Google Summer of Code with the organization, and
         * is a member of the organization
      2. **adding yourself as a GSoC participant**
         * cEP(coala Enhancement Proposal) Merged
         * Project details are valid, for example -
             * At-least one accepting Review ​from any of the maintainers
             * Issue that gives idea to solve project proposal has a label of
             “Project/Proposal”
             * Valid project link to projects website 
      3. Only organization developers or contributors who are members of more
       than one team will be able to add new **open-source google forms
       details** as well as add **new calendar events details**.
      4. **Joining the coala community** (*for newcomers*)
         * Already not a member of org!
         * Hasn't joined GitHub/GitLab recently (i.e. not created account
          in last 1 hour)
         * has pushed at-least 1 source repositories on GitHub/GitLab
         * has done any of the github training exercises etc.

3. **Login/Signup using GitHub & GitLab**

      The authentication will be a way to avoid spam activities or to avoid any
      unwanted update by the newcomers in the database. Also, we can’t use ORG
      API Token for updating user related information as there will more tasks
      which have to completed first. So, using user authentication we can get
      user their Access Token and use it to update their contributions related
      information.

      Adding auth will allow us to make sure that newcomer can’t:

      * Upload any google form
      * Participate as a mentor
      * Update the database
      * Apply for promotion to developer for any other user
      * Assign someone else to the issue

4. **Manage community members data**

      We can't use all the time organization access token to manage the
      contributors live data. Using an access token created by user by
      logging-in, will allow us to manage their data. Using the access token,
      the user contributions to the organization can be maintained in the
      database. Every time a user log-in, the access token will be refreshed
      in the database.

5. **Gamification & Meta-Review rank leader-board on homepage**

      Each table will show top 5 contributor's based on there contributions,
      they've made in the organization.

6. **Contributor Statistics**

      Since, we'll get user access token when they log-in on the community
      website. Using that, we will be fetching the contributions in a detailed
      form and store them in the database. This data will be used to display
      the contributor statistics in the form of charts. The *statistics pop-up*
      display, will have a nice UI/UX to make it more interactive. It will
      display the charts in 2D, that shows hike in contributions, activities,
      overview of contributions and many more. Along with, the issues on which
      user has worked-on will be displayed (just labels).

7. **Improve Gamification leader-board UI/UX design with added filters**

      The current layout uses just HTMl w/o any UI/UX. The improvement will
      add an interactive UI/UX design to it. Along with adding design, filters
      option and a search bar will be provided. The filters can be used to
      filter participants based on the *score range*, *gamification level* and
      *the badges*.

8. **Automate assigning of issue to contributors**

      A netlify form will be created with relevant input fields which will be
      helpful in assigning an issue to the contributor.

      Based on following checks, the issue will be assigned to avoid spam-
  
      * Not assigned to any other issue
      * If assigned, the issue has a PR to close it

      Since *corobo* does this work for us of assigning an issue to the
      contributor, but it has been down from a long time and no idea when it
      will up again for helping contributors. *corobo* provides features like
      *invitation to newcomers*, *creating an issue*, *assigning an issue* and
      many more. But due to maintenance it is down. So, this feature on
      community website can be treated for safe side. As well as it will help
      contributors by not spamming on coala main gitter channel for getting
      assigned on issue. Let's just keep that channel for coala related talk.

### Improvements

According to ​study published by adobe, 38% of people will stop engaging with a
website if the content/layout is unattractive. Therefore, this section
describes some major improvements in coala community website. Following are the
improvements:

1. **UI/UX Design improvement**
   1. Add *materialize.css*
   2. Re-design all webpages
   3. Gamification leaderboard

2. **Update README.md providing more useful information**

      1. Updated Header image

            The new header image will symbolise the meaning of *creating,
            supporting and growing* community.
      2. *Why we need this website? (Role of community)*
      3. Describing features of coala community website

3. **Update coala newcomer docs about automation features**

## coala [Webservices website](https://webservices.coala.io/)

### Enhancements

1. **New database models with endpoints**

      To enhance the website architecture these new models will play a vital
      role. It will manage all the required database records that will shown on
      coala community and projects website with which the user will be
      interacting. Following new models will be added to coala webservice api-

      * Calendar
      * Google forms
      * GSoC
      * Mentors
      * Feedback

      In addition to above new models to be created, the existing models will be
      improved to manage more database of the organization and contributor. The
      existing models that will be improved are-

      * Organization Teams
      * Contributor

2. **Keep contributors' geolocation cluster map up-to-date**

      To keep up-to-date contributors' geolocation, a new cron job will be added
      to coala webservices that will refresh the cluster map with updated
      geolocation of users. Then this map will be included on the Community
      website to show the global influence if the organization.

3. **Website homepage to display information about new enhancements**

      The information related to new endpoints created to enhance the websites
      architecture like *endpoint name, url and what it does?* will be added to
      coala Webservices homepage.

4. Add **Continuous Deployment** to Webservices

### Improvements

**Fix existing *problems***

The existing website is having some flaws which needs to be fixed-

1. There are some error's with existing **cron jobs** like the GitLab related
 cron's are running efficiently and even the data isn't being displayed.
2. coala Webservices is not being used by coala websites to fetch organization
and contributors related data which is being displayed to users on
both the websites. Instead it is getting static data from [@sks444 RawGit
 repository](https://github.com/coala/community/blob/5d83d053da31be6585dcfac18b998485c21950fc/data/webservices.py#L12).

## coala [Projects website](https://projects.coala.io/)

### Enhancements

1. **Advanced filters for searching projects**

      It should be easy for a user to search among the GSoC projects according
      to the requirements like-

      * Difficulty level,
      * Initiatives,
      * Project tags,
      * Project Status, and
      * Collaborating Projects.

2. **A tab for google forms**

      Thanks to @RohanVB for proposing this idea. Since most of the forms are
      posted on gitter and get lost with messages within a day, so why not to
      have a tab with an archive of all of the important forms? It will be one-
      stop for contributors to get all the important forms instead of just
      scrolling up on the gitter in search of the forms.

3. **A calendar web page showing important events and related info.**

      The calendar will basically be used to show GSoC (and most probably GCI)
      timeline, with milestones events created by coala GSoC'ers. Also, an
      ability for project members to publish periods of extended unavailability,
      if they want to, before and during GSoC. This can be done from coala
      community website from their profile where they can do this.

      Also calendar will be used to record significant project related events /
      posts, such as software releases, survey result announcements, cEP merges
      which affect everyone (e.g. GSoC responsibilities changes, or CoC
      updates).

4. **A tab for GSoC students**

      From past 5 years coala have been a part of GSoC and GCI like programs.
      But a disappointed fact that GSoC'ers might have in the mind that the
      organization doesn't publish any news about them. The organization must
      somehow display the selected contributors for GSoC and GCI current year
      program as well as for past years. It allows newcomers too to get
      motivated. This tab will -

      * Show all students that have been selected for GSoC in past years.
      * Design - A Collage containing all GSoCers for a year or
      * just display like admins/mentors are being shown under mentors tab

### Improvements

1. **Re-design homepage**
2. Add **UI/UX design** to GSoC project [reports page](http://projects.coala.io/reports)
3. **Responsive UI** of a GSoC report page (eg. [Project Status Report](http://projects.coala.io/GSoC/2018/StatusReport/NitanshuVashistha.html))
4. **Mark issues state** in project description popup
gsoc
      The background color of *related issues* mentioned in project description
      popup should be decided on their current state.

## Implementation

### Contributors' Geolocation

* It is important for any organization to show its global influence by showing
how people from different countries come together. 
* They join open source projects and make that project more usable or great so
that it can aid other developers as well as communities.
* To stay updated, the map will be regularly updated using a ***cron job***.
* The following code will be used to create a cluster map to show coala members
geolocation.

```python
      from github import Github
      import getorg
      gh = Github(login_or_token=<ORG_TOKEN>)
      map, org_location_dict, org_metadata_dict = getorg.orgmap.map_orgs(gh,"coala")
      getorg.orgmap.output_html_cluster_map(org_location_dict,"cluster_map")
```

* As a result, a html file will be created showing a cluster map which we can
embed in any of the HTML pages.

### New API Endpoints in coala-webservices

After the models have been created, we can connect websites to new API endpoints
and their backend to add some data which can be further used to display on
websites.

```python
      urlpatterns = [
      path('^forms/', AddGoogleForms.as_view(), name='Add Google Form'),
      path('^feedback/', AddFeedback.as_view(), name='Add Feedback'),
      path('^gsoc/mentors/', AddMentor.as_view(), name='Add Mentors'),
      path('^gsoc/participant', AddGSoCParticipant.as_view(), name='Add new participant'),
      path('^users/<str:USERNAME>', UserProfile.as_view(), name='User profile'),
      ]
```

Each endpoint will be have its own backend functionality to add data to the
models database. And, for issues related data I will be creating a cron Job.
A sample code snippet for GSoC Participant and Google Forms

* ***GSoC***
  
  * A database model to have information about all past GSoC students.
  * The contributor can add information to database from their profile section
  after or during GSoC.
  * The POST method will be having rudimentary checks to avoid spamming.

  * On API endpoint following view(*in views.py*) will be called:

      ```python
            from .serializers import GSoCParticipantSerializer
            from .models import GSOCParticipant

            class AddGSoCParticipant(ListCreateAPIView):
            permission_classes = []
            authentication_classes = []
            serializer_class = GSoCParticipantSerializer
            queryset = GSOCParticipant.objects.all()

            # POST method for adding GSoC students
            def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
                  return self.create(request, *args, **kwargs)
      ```

  * For handling/validating the POST data, a serializer class will be created
  as follows:

      ```python
            from .models import GSOCParticipant

            Class GSoCParticipantSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
            class Meta:
                  model = GSOCParticipant
                  fields = ('name', 'topic', 'year', 'personal_image')

            def validate(self, data):
                  # Perform Validation on POST data
                  return data
      ```

* ***Google Form***

  * New google forms can uploaded via profile by only developers not by newcomers.
  * GET Method will be called on projects website & POST Method on community website
  * Handling Google Form view (views.py)

      ```python
            from rest_framework.generics import ListCreateAPIView
            from .serializers import GoogleFormSerializer
            from .models import GoogleForm

            class AddGoogleForms(ListCreateAPIView):
            permission_classes = [] #TODO Newcomers can’t add forms
            authentication_classes = []
            serializer_class = GoogleFormSerializer
            queryset = GoogleForm.objects.all()

            # POST method for adding new forms
            def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
                  return self.create(request, *args, **kwargs)
      ```

  * Google form respective serializer

      ```python
            from rest_framework import serializers
            from .models import GoogleForm

            class GoogleFormSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
            class Meta:
                  model = GoogleFormSerializer
                  fields = ('title', 'url', 'description', 'end_date')

            def validate(self, data):
                  # Perform validation of POST data
                  return data
      ```

      For other API endpoints mentioned above, similarly backend functionality will
      be added with appropriate functions/classes defined in views.py and
      serializers.py.

### Would you like to contribute? A.k.a. Newcomer Invitation

* It should be easy for newcomers to join and contribute to an open-source
organization.
* It might happen that organization maintainers are not active which may lead
to late invitation to newcomers. Due to this, a bad image of organization may
get established in the world of open-source communities.
* To make easy for newcomers and start contributing in just one click, will
establish an nice and good image to that open-source enthusiast.
* From any coala website, the user can choose “Would you like to contribute?”
option to join our community.
* But, the user has to read Newcomers guide before asking for an invite. One of
rudimentary check!
* API Endpoint:

     ```python
            from .views import NewcomerInvite
            urlpatterns = [
            path('^newcomer/invite/', NewcomerInvite.as_view(), name='Newcomer invitation')
            ]
     ```

* Newcomer invitation class view:

     ```python
            from rest_framework.generics import CreateAPIView
            from .models import Contributor
            from .serializers import NewcomerInviteSerializer

            class NewcomerInvite(CreateAPIView):
            permission_classes = []
            authentication_classes = []
            serializer_class = NewcomerInviteSerializer
            queryset = Contributor.objects.all()
     ```

* Serializer class to perform some validation:

     ```python
            class NewcomerInviteSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
            class Meta:
                  model = Contributor
                  fields = '__all__'
            def validate(self, data):
                  # Validate POST data
                  # 1. newcomer_messgae == 'Hello world!'
                  #    "Check user has gone through newcomers guide or not"
                  # 2. Valid username
                  # 3. Valid newcomer issue(link provided)(optional)
                  # 4. Get user name and bio from github
                  # 5. set teams to coala_newcomers
                  # 6. Check whether is already a member or not
                  # 7. set status of account to disable
                  # 8. Perform mentioned checks too in issue
                  return data
     ```

### Want to get promoted to developer? A.k.a Promotion to Developer

* coala has a reward or a surprise gift for newcomers who have completed the
newcomers process as mentioned in Newcomer’s guide.
* This process can be automated by performing some rudimentary checks to
promote the newcomer to developer.
* A newcomer can choose “Promote to Developer” from profile page on community
website. The user can apply for this at most 3 times.
* API Endpoint:

     ```python
            from .views import NewcomerPromotion
            urlpatterns = [
            path('^newcomer/promote/', NewcomerPromotion.as_view(), name='Newcomer promotion')
            ]
     ```

* Promotion class view:

     ```python
            from rest_framework.generics import UpdateAPIView
            from .models import Contributor
            from .serializers import NewcomerPromoteSerializer

            class NewcomerPromotion(UpdateAPIView):
            permission_classes = []
            authentication_classes = []
            serializer_class = NewcomerPromoteSerializer
            queryset = Contributor.objects.all()
     ```

* Respective Serializer class for validating:

     ```python
            from rest_framework import serializers
            from .models import Contributor

            class NewcomerPromoteSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
            class Meta:
                  model = Contributor
                  fields = '__all__'

            def validate(self, data):
                  # Validate POST data
                  # Evaluate the google form
                  # 1. Get user latest entry from response spreadsheet
                  # 2. Valid data i.e.
                  #        - username
                  #        - solved newcomer issue
                  #        - solver low difficult issue
                  #        - reviewed two PRs
                  return data
     ```

* Validating this data will definitely require some amount of time.
  This can be achieved in two ways:
  1. One way is that user chooses to get promoted. Then, the API call will be
  made in background and user can’t do any work until the validating process is
  completed.
  2. Other way is create a database model which will have usernames with other
  information. And, then a cron Job will be executed for all such usernames to
  validate their information. The job will be executed for only those username
  who job scheduled was pending.

      I would like to go for second one during coding if I get enough time to
      achieve this.

### Authentication using GitHub & GitLab

* To authenticate/login user, I planned to use django-allauth.
* It won’t allow to check whether a user is member of coala community or not.
* To check it, after the user gets logged in - a check will be performed using
GitHub v3 API. If user is a part of community, it will be redirected to success
page otherwise will be redirected to invitation form!
* Must be thinking “why an open-source organization need to have authentication?”

   It’s a valid question and an important question too. The main thought to add
   implementation for it “is to avoid spamming” because we can’t provide any
   anonymous user with these rights:

  * Promotion to developer status
  * Getting assigned to an issue
  * Participate as GSoC mentor
  * Extension to non-availability period during GSoC
  * Google forms
  * Add yourself as a past GSoC student
  
      ```python
            # Non-working code.
            # A pseudo-workflow of login
            def login_using_djangoAllauth():
            user = django_allauth.Github() # Doesn't work
            return user

            def login():
            user = login_using_djangoAllauth()
            # Check user is part of coala newcomers
            # if true:
            #   success_login()
            # else:
            #   raise an error and redirect
            #   to newcomer invitation page
      ```

### Contributor Profile

One of the most important defined objective in this project is the creation of
a profile page. Following information/data will be displayed on profile along
with some options. In-order to quickly render the page, python multiprocessing
library will be made in use.
On profile page,

* Following options(enabled/disabled buttons) will be provided -
  * To only those users who are a part of coala-developers or coala-maintainers
  team
    * Participate as a Mentor
    * Add new google form
    * Add yourself as a GSoC student
    * Add/update a calendar event

      ```python
            # GitHub v3 API usage to check membership
            def participate_as_mentor():
            if user in (coala_developers() or coala_mainatiners()):
                  return True
            return False
      ```

  * To all members of community
    * Promotion to developer
    * Want to work on an issue?
    * Request to update my data(will be done via cron job)
* Following information/data will be displayed -
  * User statistics in form of graph
    * Current year contributions
      * Issues created
      * Issues solved
      * PRs Review
      * No. of commits
    * Repository-wise contributions (Overall or yearly)

      ```python
            # Overall Results
            # Yearly results can also be obtained by passing
            # an extra argument.
            def get_stats(user, repo):
            commit_count = get_commit_count(user, repo)
            review_count = get_review_count(user, repo)
            issues_cr_count = get_issue_cr_count(user, repo)
            prs_cr_count = get_prs_cr_count(user, repo)
            return {
                  'commits': commit_count,
                  'reviews': review_count,
                  'issues': issues_cr_count,
                  'prs': prs_cr_count
            }

            repos = get_repos(coala)
            repo_wise_stats = {}

            for repo in repos:
            stats = get_stats(user, repo)
            repo_wise_stats[repo] = stats
      ```

    * Comparison to previous year contributions
    * Issue solved (grouped-by labels)

      ```python
            # Return all issues assigned to user for a given organization
            # 5-6 labels will be shown in graph where last label will be
            # names as others
            issues = get_issues(user, org, state)
            issue_label_stats = {}
            for issue in issues:
            for label in issue.labels():
                  if label in issue_label_stats:
                  issue_label_stats[label] += 1
                  else:
                  issue_label_stats[label] = 1
      ```

  * Activities 
  * Rank
  * Personal Information
  * Teams
  * Total time any many more…
