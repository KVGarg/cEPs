## Abstract

This cEP describes changes to the design of [`cib`](http://gitlab.com/coala/cib/)
which will allow it to install individual bears and their dependencies.
It suggests using conda packages for bears that have different installation
instructions for each distribution and enhancing of the existing [`Requirement`](https://gitlab.com/coala/package_manager/tree/master/dependency_management/requirements)
classes.

The cEP discusses [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) which is a simple IT
automation software as a means to install bears on different distributions
by creating a playbook with the required installation instructions for all
bears.

## Introduction

The current design of the `cib` tool allows it to perform basic operations such
as running pip install on bears and then installing its dependencies. However,
some bears are not even getting installed on certain distributions and `cib` is
running into errors. Moreover, `cib` is not able to handle special cases such
as of bears that have different installation instructions for each distribution
i.e. `DartLintBear` and bears that have bear dependencies such as the
`ClangCloneDetectionBear`. Additionally, `cib` needs to be more user friendly
with a nice interface and should be able to provide verbose output,
ask user for permission before proceeding.

Another alternative to `cib` that can be used for installing bears and their
dependencies is Ansible. Ansible allows to orchestrate steps of any process
for different distributions by creating "playbooks" in YAML.
Each playbook contains a list of tasks which calls to any of the [ansible modules](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/modules_by_category.html).
A sample playbook example is shown below:

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: ensure apache is at the latest version
    yum:
      name: httpd
      state: latest
  - name: write the apache config file
    template:
      src: /srv/httpd.j2
      dest: /etc/httpd.conf
    notify:
    - restart apache
  - name: ensure apache is running (and enable it at boot)
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: started
      enabled: yes
```

Ansible provides numerous
[packaging modules](http://docs.Ansible.com/Ansible/latest/modules/list_of_packaging_modules.html)
that can be used to install dependencies of linter bears.
Another advantage of Ansible is its ability to do a large amount
of fact gathering from the user's machine and provide relevant information
such as `Ansible_distribution` and `Ansible_pkg_mgr`. These gathered facts
can be used to automatically decide in certain cases such as shown below.

```yaml
- name: install basic package
  action: >
    {{ ansible_pkg_mgr }} name=package_name
```

Other than this, Ansible also allows to have root access for installing
packages and printing verbose output. Ansible also allows filtering tasks based
on tags. This can be used to install bears for a specific language, certain
capability etc if the appropriate tags are added to the installation tasks of
the bears.

## Proposed Changes

### Conda Packaging

1. Create a new repository called `coala-bear packages`.
2. This repository will have a folder called `conda packages` that contains
   conda recepies for all the bears that require different installation
   instructions on each distribution. Each conda package requires 3 files
   i.e. `meta.yaml`, `build.sh`, `bld.bat`.
3. These packages will be uploaded to [Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.org/).
   - On Anaconda Cloud create an organization called coala.
   - The conda packages for bears and any others related to coala will be
     uploaded here.
   - These packages can be installed by running
     `conda config --add channels coala`
     which will add coala to the list of channels for the user.
     Then running `conda install bear_name` will search conda packages
     available under coala as well and install the required bear for the user.
4. Move the `generate_package` to this repository and allow it to generate
   conda packages only for the bears that are in the folder `conda packages`.

### Procedure for the installation of the bears using cib

1. Identify the valid bear names that need to be installed as specified by the
   user on the command line.
2. Install bear on the valid bear names. `cib` will check whether
   the bear can be installed from Anaconda Cloud by using `CondaRequirement`
   and then check whether it can be installed from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/)
   using `PipRequirement`.
3. After installing the bear `cib` will proceed to installing its requirements.
   `Cib` should call methods from the requirement classes to do this.
   - Add new Requirement classes to support different dependencies
     from various linters.
   - The DistributionRequirement class needs to be split into different
     classes for each package manager and call its method to introduce
     more consistency.
4. `cib` then proceeds to install bear dependencies such as for
   `ClangCloneDetectionBear` by running `install_bears` function
   for each dependency bear.

### Process for upgrading bears in cib

1. Check the bear name is installed using `CondaRequirement`
   or `PipRequirement`.
2. Iterate through `Requirement` instances to make sure that the
   required version of the linter is installed or upgrade the version
   if required.

### Split `DistributionRequirement` for each distribution

This is the list of all distributions
<http://distro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#distro.id> available from
`distro` package (excluding Darwin and Windows). Supporting all these
platforms would be too broad for this project. Therefore, the following
platforms listed below have been chosen to be completed as a part of
this project.

| Operating System | Tools   |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| Debian/Ubuntu    | apt-get |
| CentOS           | yum     |
| Fedora           | dnf     |
| Arch Linux       | pacman  |
| openSUSE/SUSE    | zypper  |
| Gentoo Linux     | portage |
| Darwin           | brew    |

1. Create a class `PlatformRequirement` representing a general requirement
   for a given distribution. This would be similiar to `PackageRequirement`
   but it will have a method to check whether the user is on the
   correct platform.
2. Then create classes such as `AptRequirement`, `YumRequirement` etc.
   that will inherit from the `PlatformRequirement` class.
3. Deprecate the `DistributionRequirement` class.

### Ansible for downloading bear and dependencies

1. Write a script in python to create a playbook that will have the installation
   instruction for each bears and its dependencies. Additionaly, a playbook
   with all instructions.
   - The script iterates over the `REQUIREMENT` instances of the bear.
     The cases for different tasks that will be generated in the playbook
     for different kinds of `REQUIREMENT` are shown in the code samples.
   - Additionally the script would add relevant tags to each installation task.
     This would include the bear name, language etc.
   - Other options for user interaction can also supported by Ansible and can be
     easily added.

### Making use of conda packages in cib

```python
from dependency_management.requirements.PipRequirement import (
    PipRequirement)
from dependency_management.requirements.CondaRequirement import (
    CondaRequirement)


def install_bears(bear_names_list):
    bear_failed_list = []
    for bear_name in bear_names_list:
        if PipRequirement(bear_name).is_installed() or \
           CondaRequirement(bear_name).is_installed():
            print(bear_name + ' is already installed.')
            continue
        if not PipRequirement(bear_name).install_package() or \
           not CondaRequirement(bear_name).install_package():
            install_requirements(bear_name)
            install_bear_dependencies(bear_name)
            print('DONE')
        else:
            print('Failed')
            bear_failed_list.append(bear_name)
    return bear_failed_list
```

### Installing bear dependencies

```python
import importlib


def install_bear_dependencies(bear_name):
    package_object = importlib.import_module(
        'coala' + bear_name + '.' + bear_name)
    for bear in getattr(package_object, bear_name).BEAR_DEPS:
        install_bears(bear)
```

### UI to ask permission for dependencies to be installed

```python
import sys
import coalib.misc.Constants as consts


def display_dependencies(bears):
    print('The bears have the following dependencies')
    for bear in bears:
        for requirement in bear.REQUIREMENTS:
            print(requirement.package, requirement.version)
    choice = raw_input().lower()
    if choice in consts.TRUE_STRINGS:
        return True
    elif choice in consts.FALSE_STRINGS:
        return False
    else:
        sys.stdout.write("Please respond with 'yes' or 'no'")
```

### Splitting `DistributionRequirement`

```python
import distro
from functools import lru_cache
import platform

        else:

```

## Ansible

### Package Requirement

```yaml
- pip:
    name: package_name
    version: 0.11
```

This can be used to install the `pip` dependencies for Bears. Ansible currently
supports the following [language specific packaging modules](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/list_of_packaging_modules.html#language).

### Distribution Requirement

#### Package name is same across different OS families

```yaml
- name: Install foo
  package: name=foo state=latest
```

Ansible provides a generic and abstracted OS `package` module that can be
used to install the required package on all distributions. For example for the
`ArtisticStyleBear` that uses a `DistributionRequirement` as shown:

```python
REQUIREMENTS = {
        DistributionRequirement(
            apt_get='astyle',
            dnf='astyle'
        )
    }
```

Then indent can be installed simply as follows

```yaml
- name: Install astyle
  package: name=astyle state=latest
```

#### When the package name is different across OS families

```yaml
# Load a variable file based on the OS type, or use default if not found.
with_first_found:
    - "../vars/{{ ansible_distribution }}.yml"
    - "../vars/{{ ansible_os_family }}.yml"
    - "../vars/default.yml"

- name: Install package_name
  package: >
    name={{ package_name }}
    state=latest

- name: Install package_name2
  package: >
    name={{ package_name2 }}
    state=latest
```

Then for each OS family describe a variable file that contains the name
of the package on that OS family.

```yaml
# vars/default.yml
package_name: name1
package_name2: name2

---
# vars/Debian.yml
package_name: name3
package_name2: name4
---
# vars/Archlinux.yml
package_name: name5
package_name2: name6
```
