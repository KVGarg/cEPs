## Abstract

This cEP describes a gamification system to automate the
recognition of activities performed by people who join the
coala community, and encourage them to progress towards
obtaining the role of "Developer" in the community.

This cEP is a part of the
[GSoC project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5892040252981248).

For the implementation of this process, this project will
incorporate a gamification system which will allow us to
track the progress of newcomers and assign some points to
each of the activities they do. There will be different
levels based on point thresholds and a newcomer will also
be eligible for specific privileges after the completion of
each level. There will also be different badges on the basis of
performed activities by the newcomers.

So, every newcomer at coala will have to complete the processes
involved in the gamification system in order to get the
**coala all-rounder** badge and then they will be eligible to apply
for the developers role at coala.

## Background

### Newcomer Experience

A newcomer at coala have to follow the
[newcomer guides](https://api.coala.io/en/latest/Developers/Newcomers_Guide.html)
and perform certain tasks mentioned there in order to be eligible
to apply for the "Developers" role at coala.

[Here](https://github.com/coala/coala/blob/4f2b3c101b8d67a17078dfb2603083c9c00537a6/docs/Developers/Newcomers_Guide.rst)
is a permanent link of the newcomer guides at the moment.

The "Developers" role at coala means that the recipient is now a part
of more trusted team, which is the organization's developers team
on GitHub.

**The problems:**

A good way to keep an open source project alive is to get new
contributors as the old ones will be busy in their own work
someday and couldn't be able to contribute on the daily basis.
So, the first and foremost problem is, how to attract
more newcomers to contribute to the community?

But, with increasing amount of newcomers, chaos comes. And it will
be hard to focus on each and every new contributor. So, there has
to be a way to manage the same. Also, to keep the newcomers
contributing to the community, a good way is needed to teach and
help them so that the work on coala progress at a fast pace.

Also there has to be a way to get more effective feedback from
the newcomers who have just started using the tools, organization
is building. And a way to use those feedback to improve coala and
its processes.

## Why Gamification?

As coala tries to be a welcoming organization for newcomers,
it gives them clear pathways and as much direct assistance as
possible. However, it is already known that newcomers face many
barriers while attempting to contribute to open source for the
first time, and additional barriers while attempting to
contribute to projects run by the coala organization.

Some barriers they face include orientation issues that can
potentially demotivate newcomers from placing their first
contribution. On the other hand, gamification is widely used
to engage and motivate people to accomplish tasks and improve
their performance.

Therefore, the goal of this project is to use gamification to
orient and motivate newcomers to overcome onboarding barriers
to contribute and engage with coala and its community.

## Gamification Introduction

There will be four game design elements to help newcomers:
Activities, Points, Badges and Levels. For each of these
elements, there will be a set of rules to describe the
operation of the gamified environment.

### Activities

Following are the activities which could tracked in this system:

- Create bug report
- Create newcomer difficulty issue
- Create external linter bear proposal issue
- Create native bear proposal issue
- Create generic bear proposal issue
- Create documentation issue
- Create low difficulty issue
- Create medium difficulty issue
- Create high difficulty issue
- Create high importance issue
- Create medium importance issue
- Create low importance issue
- Create trivial importance issue
- Merge pull request that fixes a bug
- Merge pull request for external linter bear proposal issue
- Merge pull request for native bear proposal issue
- Merge pull request for generic bear proposal issue
- Merge pull request for a documentation issue
- Merge pull request for newcomer issue
- Merge pull request for low difficulty issue
- Merge pull request for medium difficulty issue
- Merge pull request for high difficulty issue
- Merge pull request for high importance issue
- Merge pull request for medium importance issue
- Merge pull request for low importance issue

- Introduce `.coafile` in an organisation with 50 or more stars
  for its repositories
- Introduce CI in the users own repository to run coala using
  Travis CI
- Setup the Circle CI to the fork of coala repository
- Setup Travis CI to the fork of coala repository
- Setup Appveyor CI to the fork of coala repository

### Points

Points are a simple tool to reward positive contributions to coala,
and they provide an excellent base upon which to build a gamified
design. A good way to start designing this system is to assign
points to some of the tracked activities above:

- Create Issue
  - 5 points will be deduced in any type of duplicate issues
  - 5 points for importance trivial
  - 5 points for difficulty newcomer
  - 5 points for external linter bear proposal
  - 7 points for native bear proposal
  - 8 points for difficulty low
  - 10 points for type/bug
  - 10 points for importance low
  - 10 points for generic bear proposal
  - 12 points for difficulty medium
  - 15 points for difficulty high
  - 15 points for importance medium
  - 20 points for importance high
- Merge Pull Request
  - 5 points will be deduced if the pull request is duplicate
  - 5 points will be deduced if the pull request is closed without merge
  - If there are no Gitmate errors
    - 10 points for difficulty newcomer
    - 10 points for importance low
    - 12 points for writing external bear
    - 16 points for writing native bear
    - 20 points for bug fixes
    - 20 points for difficulty low
    - 20 points for importance medium
    - 20 points for writing generic bear
    - 30 points for importance high
    - 30 points for difficulty medium
    - 40 points for difficulty high
  - If Gitmate errors are b/w 1 to 10
    - 5 points for difficulty newcomer
    - 8 points for importance low
    - 8 points for writing external bear
    - 12 points for writing native bear
    - 15 points for bug fixes
    - 15 points for difficulty low
    - 15 points for importance medium
    - 15 points for writing generic bear
    - 20 points for difficulty medium
    - 25 points for importance high
    - 30 points for difficulty high
  - If Gitmate errors are b/w 10 and beyond
    - 5 points for importance low
    - 5 points for difficulty newcomer
    - 5 points for writing external bear
    - 7 points for writing native bear
    - 10 points for bug fixes
    - 10 points for difficulty low
    - 10 points for importance medium
    - 10 points for writing generic bear
    - 15 points for difficulty medium
    - 20 points for difficulty high
    - 20 points for importance high
- Activities related to introducing `.coafile`
  - 5 points
- Activities related to setting up CIs to the fork
  - 5 points

Note that these points allocations to the activities can be
change during implementation, it is just an example to have
a better understanding of this system.

This cEP relies on labels being up to date before a PR is
merged. This can be achieved by developers checking labels
on new issues, and maintainer checking the labels are up to
date before merging, but systems to improve the accuracy of
labelling of issues and PRs are beyond scope of this cEP.

In case if a newcomer creates a medium level generic bear proposal
issue, he has met the criteria for the activities of:

- Create medium difficulty issue
- Create a generic bear proposal issue

Note that in this case points would not add up. There will be
a method to check that which activity is assigned with the
highest number of points and the newcomer will be awarded
with those points. Also, there will be more method for scoring in
the cases when assigining points based on the activity with higher
points would not be good. E.g.:

Creating an issue which has importance/high(20 points) and
difficulty/newcomer(5 points) labels.

### Levels

To increase a user's competitive instinct, a series of levels can be
implemented that confer rank as newcomers become more active. A good
and straightforward way to award levels in a new gamified design is
to base them on point thresholds. As users earn points, they move up
an incremental series of levels. To infuse the level with meaning i.e.:
a ranking within the system, the levels should be named in a way that
indicates status.

But the levels wouldn't be enough motivation to go until newcomers
have some special privileges after completing each level:

Note that the following levels are an example of possible levels
with suggested privileges based on the example points allocations
in the previous section.

- Level-I:
  - Name: Fresher
  - Points_required = 0
  - Privileges:
    - No privileges for freshers
- Level-II:
  - Name: Newbie
  - Points_required = 10
  - Privileges:
    - Get assigned to newcomers issue
- Level-III:
  - Name: Beginner
  - Points_required = 20
  - Privileges:
    - Get assigned to a difficulty low issue
- Level-IV:
  - Name: Intermediate
  - Points_required = 50
  - Privileges:
    - Mark your own PR as wip
- Level-V:
  - Name: Cool
  - Points_required = 100
  - Privileges:
    - Mark a PR by another newcomer as wip
    - Get assigned to difficulty medium issue
- Level-VI:
  - Name: Expert
  - Points_required = 200
  - Privileges
    - Assign newcomers to difficulty newcomer issue
    - Assign newcomers to difficulty low issue
- Level-VII:
  - Name: Legend
  - Points_required = 350
  - Privileges
    - Invite newcomers to org
    - Assign newcomers to difficulty medium issue
    - Permission to `ack` and `unack` on the pull requests

Implementation of privileges is beyond scope of the
gamification system. The gamification system will merely
expose a list of privileges that each person has, and other
systems are expected to adapt to use these privileges.
E.g.: [corobo](https://github.com/coala/corobo)

While implementing privileges, a first manual check should
be done for testing purpose, and then automated only if there
is no serious risk or there is a good risk reaction mechanism
in place.

### Badges

Another way of explicitly nudging a newcomer to action is to
award badges for completing tasks. Badges enable newcomers to
follow their performance and compare to other newcomers.
Badges will be awarded after performing certain activities by
the newcomers:

- The bug finder:
  - Details: The one who find bugs in the existing codebase
  - Activities:
    - Create at least one issue which labelled as bug
- The bear hunter:
  - Details: The one who create issues about new bears
  - Activities:
    - Create at least one native bear proposal issue
    - Create at least one generic bear proposal issue
- The bear writer:
  - Details: The one who write new bears
  - Activities:
    - Merge at least one external linter bear proposal pull request
    - Merge at least one native bear proposal pull request
- The helper:
  - Details: The one who help other newcomers
  - Activities:
    - At least 20 answers given on coala Gitter rooms
    - Reviewed at least 1 high importance pull request
    - Merge at least 1 high importance pull request
- The reviewer:
  - Details: The one who review others' pull requests
  - Activities:
    - Review at least 3 difficulty newcomer pull requests
    - Review at least 2 difficulty low pull requests
- The super reviewer:
  - Details: The one who is the legend of reviewing
  - Activities:
    - Review at least 10 newcomer difficulty pull requests
    - Review at least 7 low difficulty pull requests
    - Review at least 3 medium difficulty pull requests
- The coala all-rounder:
  - Details: Has met the prerequisites to apply for the coala developer role
  - Activities:
    - Introduce `.coafile` in user own repository
    - Merge a difficulty/newcomer Pull Request
    - Review at least a difficulty/newcomer Pull Request
    - Merge a difficulty/low Pull Request
    - Review at least a difficulty/low or higher Pull Request

So, to be eligible to be a developer at coala, a newcomer must
complete all the activities mentioned in the `coala all-rounder`
badge. But in case if some of the newcomers are not able to be
eligible to apply for coala developer role, they could take away
the other badges.

Names and metrics of tracked activities will also be shown
on the leaderboard along with the number of times they
have been done. That will help maintainers to varify if an
automatically awarded badge is correct or not.

Note that in case of an issue or a pull request has two labels which
are counted in this system, the performed activities by the user will
be two, and both the activities will be counted while awarding badges.
So in case if there is a badge for creating a medium difficulty issue
and there is a badge for creating a bear proposal issue, both badges
will be awarded to the newcomer who has created a medium difficulty
bear proposal issue.

## Implementation

### Getting the data

#### GitHub/GitLab

For getting the data related to newcomers activity on
GitHub/GitLab to the community, this system will mainly
use [IGitt](https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt).

#### Gitter

For getting the stats of newcomers' messages, this system
will use
[Gitter API](https://developer.gitter.im/docs/messages-resource)
and import all the messages by newcomers in webservices. And
then those messages will be imported to the community repo
into two Django models, i.e.: `Question` and `Answer`.
The `Question` model will be responsible for storing all
the questions asked by the newcomers in coala Gitter rooms.
And the `Answer` model will be responsible for storing all
the answers given by the newcomers in coala Gitter rooms.
And these numbers will be shown on the user's dashboard along
with each completed milestones of the newcomer. This will help
us to figure out how much a newcomer has been noisy, or how
much they have asked questions and how much they have helped
others while completing certain tasks and not promote them
to developers team until they have learned to learn things
by themselves.

E.g.: [Here](https://gist.github.com/sks444/66c5d8e7704708fda50569fd3ce3a4db)
is the log of some frequent questions asked by a newcomer
while solving an issue, which clearly shows that the
newcomer is noisy and has not been through newcomer docs.
So, this system will count the number of questions asked by
that newcomer, and show it to the leaderboard along with
the issue they have completed.

### A System for Tracking Activities, Points and Levels

Now that the rules for our gamification design are ready and
the relevant data is imported in the community repo, a good

way to start the implementation of gamification system is to
design some models and methods to track the user's activity,
points and levels:

#### Creating the activity model

An Activity model will give a way to keep a log of each time
the user earns or loses points so that there will be a record
of his points history on a dashboard.

A mockup of a basic `Activity` Django model would look something
like:

```python
class Actvity(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=500)
    details = models.TextField()
    points = models.IntegerField()
    number_of_times = model.IntegerField(default=0)
```

`number_of_times` field store the value of number of times
an activity has been done by the same user.

The `User` model will have a `ManyToMany` relationship with
the `Activity` model with a method named
`count_similar_activity` which will check if the action
by the user has been done previously? If Yes, it will
increase `number_of_times` field with one.

#### Creating the Level Model

A mockup of basic `Level` Django model would look something like:

```python
class Level(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField()
    points_required = model.IntegerField()
    user = models.ManytoManyField(User)
    privileges = models.ForeignKey(Privilege)


class Privilege(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=500)
```

And a query to create a level would be:

```python
privilege = Privilege.objects.create(
    name='Get assigned to a newcomer issue',
    )
level1 = Level.obejects.create(
    name='Newbie',
    points_required=5,
    privileges=privilege,
    )
```

#### Extending the User Model to add points and Levels

Whenever a user perform an activity his points will be increased.
So, there should be some methods to check if the user has achieved
a new level:

```python
class User(models.Model):
    ...
    ...
    points = models.IntegerField()
    level = models.CharField()
    ...

    def add_points()
        a_method_to_update_points_and_level()
        a_method_for_the_log_of_the_activities()
```

#### Creating the Badges model

```python
class Badge(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField()
    description = model.TextField()
```

The Badge model much like our Level model, defines a range of
possible awards that a user can receive. Unlike levels, users
can have many badges at one time. This sets up a many-to-many
relationship between badges and users, so there is a need of an
intermediate model to track which badges a user has earned.
The model will be called `Achievement`:

```python
class Achievement(models.Model):
    user_id = ManyToManyField(User)
    bage_id = ManyToManyField(Badge)
```

Now, to make awarding badges easier, let’s also add a
convenience method to the User model:

```python
def award_badge(name):
    badge = Badge.objects.filter(name=name)
    badges.award(name)
```

### Deployment and The leaderboard

There will be Django management commands for each of the
needed processes which will be triggered on each build of
netlify and show the useful updated user metrics and stats
on the leaderboard.

The leaderboard will have the following columns:

| Username | Activities Performed | Points | Levels | Badges |

`Username` column will show the usernames of each newcomer.

`Activities Performed` column will show all the activities perforemd
by the newcomer along with the number of questions aksed and answers
given on coala Gitter channels while performing those activities.

`Points` column will show the total points earned by the newcomer.

`Levels` column will show the current level of the
newcomer with enabled privileges.

`Badges` column will show the badges earned by the user based on
their activity.

The leaderboard will be sorted based on the total points earned
by newcomers, which means that the newcomer with highest points
will be on top and the points are directly connected to the levels,
So, the newcomer at the top will also be on the highest level.

## Conclusion

This project addresses the most of the problems a
newcomer at coala face during the newcomer to
developer process and tries to provide a simplified and
automated solution:

- A maintainer doesn't have to check manually if the
  newcomer has done all the activities involved
  in newcomer->developer process, they can just look at
  the points and badges earned by the newcomer through
  the gamification system. However, this system doesn't yet
  provide maintainers with the assurance of the quality of the
  work, so some manual verification will still be required.

- This project provides a fun way to work in the community,
  newcomers will be motivated to work when they will earn
  points and badges even for the tiniest bit of their
  contributions.

- Having a gamification system will be a good resource to
  attract more newcomers and the automation process could
  easily deal with an increase in the number of new contributors.

- In case if some of the newcomers are not able to complete
  the newcomer process they can get other available badges
  based on their activities in the community, which will be a
  kind of symbol of their talent and work experience in OSS
  projects.

- Keeping track of newcomers' messages on Gitter channels will
  help us to know how much noisy a newcomer is during performing
  certain tasks and not promote them to developers until they
  have started to find the solution of their problems on their own.
